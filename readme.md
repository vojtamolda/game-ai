## Sheriff Chase - [`sheriff/`](sheriff/)
Implementation of value iteration, policy iteration and Q learning algorithms that search for the optimal
policy. The game is a simple deterministic implementation of an OpenAI gym environment extended to Markov
Decision Process.

## Game of Life - [`life/`](life/)
Gray-Scott reaction diffusion system and a simple cellular automaton with a fancy history fading visualization bundled
in one compact application.

## Tetris - [`tetris/`](tetris/)
Yet another clone of the greatest game of all time. Peppered up with fancy tetrimino bouncing animation.

## Fourplay - [`fourplay/`](fourplay/)
Logical game for two with a quite-hard (but not impossible) to beat AI. One algorithm uses depth first search with
branch pruning of obviously wrong choices for speed-up and looks 8 moves ahead.

## Maze - [`maze/`](maze/)
Maze typically found in a children's magazine generated by a stochastic DFS algorithm. This guarantees that the end of
the maze is always hard to get to. Also check out the fancy ball animations :)

## Minesweeper - [`minesweeper/`](minesweeper/)
Clone of the only good software produced by a certain Seattle company...

## Tic-Tac-Toe - [`tictactoe/`](tictactoe/)
Oldie but goodie 3 by 3 noughts against crosses. Peppered up with a simple AI. Good luck trying to beat it ;)
