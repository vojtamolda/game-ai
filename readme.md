## Fourplay - `fourplay.py`
Logical game for two with a quite-hard (but not impossible) to beat AI. The algorithm uses a version of
[depth-first-search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search) which does branch pruning of obviously wrong choices for speed-up. The AI looks 8 moves ahead.

__How to play__: Form a straight line out of four dots!

__Details__: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four)

## Maze - `maze.py`
Maze from a children magazine generated by a stochastic [depth-first-search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search)
algorithm. This guarantees that the end of the maze is always hard to get to. Also check out the fancy ball animations :)

__How to play__: Get the ball to the end of the maze!

__Details__: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze)
